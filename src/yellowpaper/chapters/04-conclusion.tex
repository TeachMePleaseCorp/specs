\section{Conclusion}
In this paper we presented the architecture of the Disciplina platform. The described architecture provides a way to store the educational records on the blockchain while preserving the privacy of these records. The concepts of private chains and the digital CV make it possible to verify the educational records of a particular person. The Archivist entities provide reputational semantics to the educational institutes listed in the digital CVs.

We developed our platform as not only the source of trust, but as a database of the students all over the world. We believe that the data that is stored in the system has a value of itself. The need to disclose this data was also addressed in the paper: we described a mechanism for the fair data trade and measures against the secondary market arousal.
