\section{Future work}
The current architecture of the Disciplina platform heavily relies on the external entities -- the Archivists -- to add a layer of trust and provide ratings for the educational institutions and private teachers. However, it is possible that such external entities would provide unfair ratings: for example, they could ignore the existence of private teachers, thus making their contributions less valuable. The reliance on the third parties can be avoided if we carefully integrate the algorithm of rating computation into our architecture. The ratings would be based on the on-chain sources of information and provide equal opportunities for both private teachers and large educational institutions. However, integrating the rating system into the arhitecture poses several design challenges that we have to solve.
