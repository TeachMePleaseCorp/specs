\subsection{Search queries}
For every vertex $subjectId$ in the ATG, we can define 
$avgGrade_{subjectId}$ as a weighted average of all grades in this subgraph. It could be a good approximation of the score of a student in this area of knowledge.

Educator can answer one of the following queries:
\begin{itemize}
\item For a set of pairs $(subjectId_1, minGrade_1)$, $(subjectId_2, minGrade_2)$, ..., $(subject_n, minGrade_n)$ and some $Count$, find no more than $Count$  students with grades satisfying the following inequalities:
\[
\left\{
\begin{array}{c}
avgGrade_{subjectId_1} >= minGrade_1 \\ avgGrade_{subjectId_2} >= minGrade_2 \\
\mathrel{\makebox[\widthof{=}]{\vdots}} \\ avgGrade_{subjectId_n} >= minGrade_n
\end{array}
\right.
\]

\item For a given identifier of student, return all info about this student.
\end{itemize}
