\subsection{Private chain}
\label{sec:priv-chain}

Every educator has a private chain. It stores the data about students, and can generate answers for the queries described above.

Private chain comprises of two main data structures:
\begin{itemize}
\item Set of transactions batched into blocks. Every block contains a list of transactions packed into a Merkle tree.
\item The database, that stores links to transactions in the Merkle tree, this indexed by tuples $(studentId, studentGrades)$. This database 
\end{itemize}

The structure of the private block is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:privateblocks}. The block consists of a public \textit{header} that the Educators relay to the Witnesses, and the private \textit{body} that remains in the educational institute until it receives a data disclosure request.

During the educational process the Educators emit atomic \textit{private transactions}. These tansactions represent the modifications to the journal of academic achievements (thus, making a transaction means appending the data to the journal). The transactions can be of the following types:
\begin{itemize}
\item student enrolls in a course;
\item student gets an assignment;
\item student submits an assignment;
\item student gets a grade for an assignment;
\item student gets a final grade for the course.
\end{itemize}

The first two types should be intiated by a student, and should include student's signature to prevent spam from partially-honest educator.
The structure of the transaction is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:private-transactions}.

Let us denote an $i$-th transaction in a block as $T_{priv}^i$. The Educators group the transactions that occured during the current block time slot, and construct a Merkle tree \cite{merkle1989certified} for these journal modifications:
\begin{equation}
M_{priv} = \MerkleTree(T_{priv}^i)
\end{equation}

\end{figure}



The Educator's private block body comprises an ordered set of Merkle-authenticated transactions. These transactions are indexed so that the Educator can quickly find a particular transaction that satisfies some predicate.

The private block header consists of the transactions Merkle root along with the previous block hash and the information on the Activity Type Graph modifications (ATG delta). The \textit{ATG delta} part allows the Educators to inform the Witnesses and the Archivists of the modifications to the courses they teach.

An Educator collects private transactions into the blocks with no more than $K$ transactions per each block. After that, an Educator submits signed block header to the Witnesses so that private transactions can be confirmed by the public chain. Thus, the private blocks form a publicly verifiable chain of events.

To incentivize Witnesses to include private block headers into the public chain, an Educator should pay some amount of coins per each private block. We should take into consideration that an educator may be both a local tutor and some big university. Depending on that, a number of transactions per each block, as well as paying capacity, may differ. So the cost of a digest publication linearly grows with the size. To achieve the ability to prove the size of the Merkle tree, we will store it together with a hash in each node(as shown in \ref{fig:merkle-tree}). So every transaction disclosure will also verify the size. [The alternative idea described in the appendix].
