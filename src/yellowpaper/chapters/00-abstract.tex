\begin{abstract}
In this paper we analyze the main issues that arise from storing educational records in blockchain and propose the architecture of Disciplina platform -- the domain-specific blockchain implementation. The platform is designed to act like a decentralized ledger with special respect to privacy and mechanisms of data disclosure. We present an overview of the main entities, their roles and incentives to support the network. Please mind that the project is a work-in-progress and the descriptions provided are subject to change.
