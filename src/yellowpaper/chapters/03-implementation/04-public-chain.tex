\subsection{Public chain}
The Witnesses maintain a public chain -- a distributed ledger that contains publicly available information. If one wishes to perform a transaction on the public chain, she has to pay a certain fee that serves two purposes. First of all, the fee incentivizes the Witnesses to participate in the network and issue new blocks. Second, by requiring a fee for each transaction, we protect the public ledger from being spammed.

We present the structure of the public blocks in Figure \ref{fig:publicblocks}. The public ledger contains the following information:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Modification history of the Activity Type Graph.
\item Private transaction proofs.
\item Account balances and value transfer history.
\end{enumerate}

There are two major ways to store the account balances and other state information: UTXO and account-based architectures. UTXO is an unspent transaction output, that contains some predicate -- a condition that has to be fulfilled in order to spend the coins. To prove the money ownership, the spender provides a witness -- an input that makes the predicate true. Thus, the UTXO-based architecture requires the transactions to be stateless, effectively limiting the application domain \cite{bentov2017instantaneous}.  The unspent outputs with an associated state can be treated as smart-contracts in the account-based architectures like Ethereum \cite{wood2014ethereum}. The state is stored in an off-chain storage -- the state database. The transactions are treated as the modifications of the world state. We are going to develop an UTXO-based ledger with transactions programmable in Plutus language \cite{Plutus}.

The recent achievements in the field of consensus protocols, like the provably secure Ouroboros \cite{kiayias2017ouroboros}, allow us to build a public chain based on the Proof of Stake consensus rules. Thus, we can increase the transaction speed and drop the need for the expensive mining. However, with mining being dropped, we need to provide incentives for the Witnesses to maintain the chain and participate in the network.
