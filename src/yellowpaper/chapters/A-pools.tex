\subsection{Partially centralized educators}
\label{apx:pools}

In the Section~\ref{sec:priv-chain} we have concluded that the cost of the

alternative idea how to solve inequality between local tutors and big
universities is to delegate block generation to the special platforms for
tutors(e.g. \url{teachmeplease.com}).
